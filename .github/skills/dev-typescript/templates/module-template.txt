# staystack-ts TypeScript module template

# Purpose
Describe the pure function(s) and data structures; identify which staybase primitives you reuse.

# Imports (ordered with .js extensions for relatives)
# import { something } from "node:crypto"
# import type { Foo } from "@staytunedllp/staybase/foo"
# import { helper } from "./helper.js"

# Types
# - Use type aliases, readonly fields, discriminated unions.
# - Avoid enums and interfaces (except when extending third-party types).

# Functions
# - Pure functions only; no classes/this/new.
# - Model fallible paths with Result or Task; no throw/try.
# - No loops or mutation; use map/filter/reduce and immutable updates.
# - Explicit return types on every function.

# Validation
# - Parse-Don't-Validate: convert unknown to typed data with strict guards.
# - Distinguish null vs undefined; avoid implicit boolean coercion.

# Performance
# - Avoid O(N^2) patterns; prefer push-based accumulation then spread once.
# - Use UTC date/time methods.

# Security
# - No dynamic property access on untrusted keys; whitelist instead.
# - No eval or Function constructors; avoid non-literal fs paths.

# Testing and checks
# - npm run build
# - npm run lint
# - npm run format:check
