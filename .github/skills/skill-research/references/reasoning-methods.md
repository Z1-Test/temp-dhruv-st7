# Research Reasoning Methods

This document defines explicit reasoning patterns used by the research skill.

---

## Primary Pattern: Thematic Synthesis

**When to use**: Default for most research tasks. Best for identifying patterns across sources.

### Steps

1. **Extract Claims** - Pull key assertions from each source
2. **Cluster by Theme** - Group similar claims together
3. **Cross-Reference** - Verify claims across multiple sources
4. **Identify Patterns** - Note agreements and contradictions
5. **Synthesize** - Produce unified findings with attribution

### Example Application

```
Sources: 3 articles on CSS Container Queries
→ Extract: 15 claims about syntax, browser support, use cases
→ Cluster: "Syntax" (5), "Browser Support" (4), "Use Cases" (6)
→ Cross-Reference: All agree on syntax, 1 outdated on support
→ Pattern: Consensus on syntax, some stale browser data
→ Output: Structured facets with freshness warnings
```

## Alternative Patterns

### Systematic Scan

**When to use**: Comprehensive coverage needed, checklist-style research.

| Step | Action | Output |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Define scope boundaries | Inclusion/exclusion criteria |
| 2 | Enumerate all sources | Source inventory |
| 3 | Extract systematically | Structured data per source |
| 4 | Categorize findings | Taxonomy |
| 5 | Prioritize | Ranked list |

**Best for**: Technology comparisons, feature matrices, compliance checks.

### Compare-Contrast

**When to use**: Multiple viewpoints or competing technologies.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Identify comparison dimensions |
| 2 | Align sources by dimension |
| 3 | Note agreements |
| 4 | Highlight disagreements |
| 5 | Explain differences |

**Best for**: Framework comparisons, opinion pieces, methodology debates.

### Gap Analysis

**When to use**: Finding research holes or unexplored areas.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Map existing coverage |
| 2 | Identify expected topics |
| 3 | Find missing areas |
| 4 | Assess gap significance |
| 5 | Suggest directions |

**Best for**: Literature reviews, research proposals, roadmap planning.
